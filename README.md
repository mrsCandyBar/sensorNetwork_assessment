# sensorNetwork Assessment

Assessment to create a search for github users by name.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
### `npm test`
### `npm run build`


I've built this off a template that I'd made prior to speed up production on future assessment tasks.
That template can be found here : https://github.com/mrsCandyBar/react_crud_and_login
The commits for this template can be found here : https://github.com/mrsCandyBar/react_crud_and_login/commits/main

# PLEASE NOTE 
I try to be as verbose as possible with my commit messages, so have a look at the commits to understand what I had been trying to achieve for the task I'd been trying to complete. You should be able to find my commits here : https://github.com/mrsCandyBar/sensorNetwork_assessment/commits/main

# Final note
I hope this project meets your expectations. And if you have any additional questions please do reach out to me.
I wish you an amazing day ahead of you. 

Happy reviewing friend,
Candy Bar
